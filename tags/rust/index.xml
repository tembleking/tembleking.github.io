      <description>I have recently started working on the final project for the University, and I decided to do it in Rust, mainly to learn more about the language. You can try to learn a language by just reading, but the actual learning comes from actually writing code and facing the creation of a working program.
I am currently a Go developer at Sysdig, and I have to admit that I tried to write Rust code like I wrote Go.</description>
